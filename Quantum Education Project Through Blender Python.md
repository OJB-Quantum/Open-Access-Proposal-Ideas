# **Q-EDU-Forge** — A Mini Open-Source Project for Quantum Education & Simulation (Granite-Assisted)

> **Portmanteau & Etymology.** **Q-EDU-Forge** merges “Q” (quantum), “EDU” (education), and “Forge” (workshop for shaping tools; from Latin *fabrica*), denoting, practically and purposefully, a place to shape, test, and publish quantum learning tools.

---

## 0) Concept in One Minute (High-School Level)

With simple steps and with visual tools, students will run small quantum experiments on their laptops, while a helpful artificial intelligence tutor writes, explains, and corrects code as they go. The project supplies ready-to-run Google Colab notebooks, clear videos, and interactive visualizations. Because it is open-source, teachers and learners everywhere, freely and collaboratively, can improve it.

---

## 1) Technical Rationale (Graduate Level)

Analytically and systematically, we combine:  
1) **Reusable, Colab-ready notebooks** for quantum circuits, channels, and device-adjacent simulations (e.g., Hamiltonian models, noise, simple transport);  
2) **An agentic tutor** that uses IBM Granite foundation models for code explanation, scaffolded practice, and formative assessment;  
3) **Visualization pipelines** that export to the Visualization Toolkit (VTK) for ParaView, thereby enabling field, state, and lattice visualizations;  
4) **Rigorous templates** (PEP 8, PEP 257, Google style) and “control knobs” for parameters, reproducibly.

This pairs generative assistance with verifiable computation and keeps environments stable by pinning dependencies, while offering a model-agnostic abstraction so the tutor can be swapped if credits or endpoints change.

---

## 2) Problem Statement & Objectives

**Problem.** Beginners and practitioners, globally and consistently, face fragmented resources, brittle environments, and minimal feedback when learning quantum computing and device-adjacent modeling.

**Objectives.**
- Provide, rapidly and transparently, a **cohesive starter curriculum** with runnable notebooks and parameterized experiments.  
- Offer, iteratively and adaptively, a **Granite-assisted tutor** that explains, critiques, and tests code.  
- Deliver, visually and interactively, **ParaView-ready outputs** for states, channels, and fields.  
- Publish, openly and permissively, **curriculum + code + data** under Apache-2.0 / CC-BY 4.0.

## 3) Scope, Work Packages, and Deliverables

### WP-A — **Core Edusim Notebooks** (Colab-first)
- **A1. Qubits & Gates**: state prep, Bloch vectors, $\lvert\psi\rangle$ superpositions, measurement.  
  *Knobs*: number of shots, noise levels, gate angles.
- **A2. Circuits & Channels**: Kraus maps, depolarizing / amplitude damping, tomography.  
  *Knobs*: channel parameters, tomography depth.
- **A3. Variational Mini-Lab**: two-qubit VQE on toy Hamiltonians; optimizer sweeps.  
  *Knobs*: ansatz depth, learning rate, random seed.
- **A4. Transport & Lattices (intro)**: tight-binding toy models, band sketches, VTK exports for 3-D viewing.  
  *Knobs*: lattice size, hopping terms, boundary conditions.

**Deliverables (A):** Four Colab notebooks with unit tests, datasets, and VTK exporters.

### WP-B — **Granite-Assisted Tutor**
- **B1. Prompt templates** for “explain this error,” “write unit tests,” “generate scaffolds,” and “Socratic hints.”

- **B3. Lesson generator**: produces graded practice sets from a concept map.  
**Deliverables (B):** Tutor module, example configs, and usage docs. *Provider-agnostic interface; Granite preferred when credits are available.*

### WP-C — **Visualization & Export**
- **C1. VTK export** from NumPy arrays and density matrices (isosurfaces / glyphs).  
- **C2. ParaView recipes** for pipelines and colorbars; reproducible figures.  
**Deliverables (C):** `viz/` utilities and ParaView state files.

### WP-D — **Pedagogy & Assessment**

- **D2. Instructor guide** with pacing, pitfalls, and accessibility notes.  
**Deliverables (D):** Instructor PDF, rubric JSON, and example grading scripts.

## 4) Minimal Viable Release (MVR)

| Item | Description | Acceptance Test |
|-|-|-|
| MVR-1 | Notebook A1 runs on Colab GPU/ CPU with no manual fixes | Unit tests pass; renders Bloch sphere & histograms |
| MVR-2 | Tutor answers “why did my circuit fail?” and cites the offending code | Returns a fix + explanation + runnable diff |
| MVR-3 | ParaView pipeline renders exported VTK from A2/A3 | Opens `.vtp`/`.vti`; shows legend & camera presets |
| MVR-4 | One formative quiz per notebook | Autograder yields score with hints |

---

## 5) Architecture (Text Diagram)

```

[User (Colab)]
├─> Notebooks (A1–A4) ──> Compute (Qiskit simulators; NumPy/SciPy)
├─> Tutor (B1–B3) ──────> Granite / provider-agnostic endpoints ──> Hints/Scaffolds
└─> Viz (C1–C2) ───────> VTK writers ──> ParaView scenes

```

*Granite endpoints and credits are optional; the abstraction allows drop-in replacement with local or other hosted models.*

---

## 6) Open Licensing & Governance

- **Code**: Apache-2.0; **Educational content**: CC-BY 4.0; **Data**: CC0 where possible.  
- **Governance**: CONTRIBUTING.md, CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md, issue templates, and a lightweight RFC folder.  
- **Releases**: Semantic versioning, tagged artifacts, and DOI via Zenodo.

## 8) Budget & Funding Map (Mini-Grant Scale)

| Line | Need | Cost (USD) | Notes / Fit |
|---|---|---:|---|
| L1 | Stipend for 12 weeks (single developer-educator) | 3,000 | Seeded by microgrant; scope-capped MVR |
| L2 | Cloud credits (AI inference & hosting) | 0–500 | Free trials/credits, hackathons, academic programs |
| L3 | Design, captioning, accessibility passes | 200 | Alt-text, transcripts, contrast checks |
| L4 | Dissemination (workshop streaming, domain) | 200 | Minimal hosting and recording |

**Primary cash ask:** USD $4,000 microgrant. **In-kind credits:** IBM trials/credits and hackathons when available.

---

## 9) Eligibility & Program Alignment (for Applications)

- **Unitary Foundation (Unitary Fund) Microgrants.** Open to individuals globally; $4,000 grants; short application with clear open-source scope; education and open software are explicitly in scope.  
- **IBM Granite / Watsonx-aligned Hackathons & Call for Code.** Global, individual-friendly; Granite use welcome; cash awards plus IBM Cloud credits; ideal venue to showcase the tutor module and the education theme.  
- **IBM Cloud Free Tier, Academic Initiative, Startup Programs.** Free trials and credits to enable Granite endpoints and hosting without cash burn.

## 10) Risk & Mitigation

| Risk | Impact | Mitigation |
|---|---|---|
| API/model drift (Granite or alternative) | Tutor prompts degrade | Pin versions; ship offline “no-LLM” paths; abstract provider layer |
| Environment brittleness | Onboarding friction | Colab-first; `requirements.txt`; smoke tests; reproducible seeds |
| Scope creep | Delays | MVR gate; four-notebook cap in v1.0; backlog triage weekly |
| Visualization complexity | Steep learning | Ship ParaView states; include low-threshold presets and screenshots |

---

## 11) Evaluation & Impact Metrics

- **Adoption**: GitHub stars, forks, unique Colab runs, VTK/ParaView file downloads.  
- **Learning**: Quiz improvement deltas; completion rates; anonymous feedback forms.  
- **Diversity & Reach**: Countries served; institutions adopting modules.  
- **Sustainability**: External PRs; issues closed; new maintainers onboarded.

---

## 12) Community Plan

- **Docs & Tutorials**: Screen-captures, captions, and written guides for each notebook.  
- **Workshops**: Two online sessions (recorded), one educator roundtable.  
- **Ecosystem Bridges**: Integration examples for Qiskit; clear “good first issue” tasks.  
- **Showcases**: Submit to Granite-aligned hackathons; present outcomes publicly.

---

## 13) Naming Conventions & Identity Shifts (Counterfactuals)

If hosted-model access were unavailable, we would, practically and transparently, switch to an open model (e.g., a local instruction-tuned LLM) and rename the tutor extension to **“Open-Tutor”** in the docs while preserving **Q-EDU-Forge** as the umbrella. Functionally, the identity of the *tutor module* would change (provider-agnostic), while the *project identity* would remain consistent.

### Appendix: Example Learning Outcome (A2)

- **HS-level**: Describe, verbally and graphically, how a depolarizing channel shrinks the Bloch sphere and reduces the probability of measuring $\lvert 0\rangle$ or $\lvert 1\rangle$ as expected.  
- **Graduate-level**: Implement Kraus maps $E_k$ for amplitude damping, verify complete positivity and trace preservation, and estimate channel parameters via maximum-likelihood tomography on measurement data.
